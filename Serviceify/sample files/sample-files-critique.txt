The following is the critique for sample files 1 and 2 -->
Sample file 1:
    1. No title
    2. The file will not necessarily show content satisfactorily on different devices
       (tablets, mobiles etc.)
    3. Uneven syntax with the <h2> and <p> tags.
    4. Usage of <i> tag instead of <em>.
    5. No opening brackets in <p> under <h3>.
    6. No alt attribute in the <img> tag.
    7. Extra <ul> that makes no visual difference.
    8. Inlcuding table in <h3> makes no visual difference.
    9. Missing unit in table border (not an error, still a suggestion though)

Sample file 2:
    1. Uses a specific doctype declaration which may not run on all browsers. (Not an error but 
       recommended to be careful while using CSS with it.)
    2. Title is not descriptive.
    3. Redundant xmlns namespace declaration
    4. The file will not necessarily show content satisfactorily on different devices
       (tablets, mobiles etc.) 

Corrections made:
Sample file 1:
    1. Added Title
    2. Added width=device-width
    3. Corrected the placement of text in <h2> and <p> tags.
    4. Replaced <i> with <em>
    5. Added the missing '(' (not an error but a suggestion)
    6. Added alt attribute.
    7. Corrected redundant <ul> tag.
    8. Modified <h3> due to redundancy.
    9. Added the missing unit 'px' (not an error, still a suggestion though)

Sample file 2:
    1. Added a descriptive title
    2. Added width=device-width
    NOTE: The xmlns namespace was not removed but pertaining to this particular file, it is Redundant
